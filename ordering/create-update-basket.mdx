  and receive reward redemption information in return. A basket can be in one of
  the following states:"
---

- `checkout`
  - refers to any point before the order is placed. Any time the user updates
    their basket or rewards, Thanx expects to receive a request to check if
    discount information should be updated.
- `placed`
  - refers to when an order has been submitted to the system and a user can no
    longer modify their order through the website.
- `billed`
  - refers to when the order has been trasmitted to the POS and the user's
    credit card has been charged.
- `completed`
  - refers to when the order has been made and transferred to the customer.
- `voided`
  - refers to an order that got canceled after entering the placed state and
    before entering the billed state.
- `refunded`
  - refers to an order being refunded / canceled any time after it enters the
    billed state.

<Info>
  Thanx will mark a reward as used and grant loyalty reward progress when the
  basket enters the `billed` state.
