## Certification

When you are ready for your integration to be certified, let your customer success representative know.
Certification will take a week. If certification fails, the 1 week timeline will begin again.

Upon certification of your integration in the Sandbox environment, you will be provided
with a set of production credentials that will allow you access to our Production environment.
