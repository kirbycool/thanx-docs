## Push Notifications

Thanx sends users push notifications in a variety of situations, such as when
they make a purchase or earn a reward. We can send push notifications to your app
as well. When you are ready to register your app with Thanx for push notifications,
you should send your CSM at Thanx your APNS certificate, FCM server key, and sender ID
via a secure mechanism, such as Dropbox Transfer.

The rest of this page provides information regarding the types of push notifications
that Thanx currently sends.

A push notification payload will contain an event key and a merchant key. Each notification type may have other information provided. The sample notification text provided is not set in stone and will
sometimes vary depending on the kinds of campaigns a merchant is running.
