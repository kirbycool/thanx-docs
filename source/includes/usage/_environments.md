## Environments

Thanx provides a sandbox environment for you to develop against. The data in the
sandbox environment is isolated from production data. All new development must be validated and tested against the sandbox environment prior to being released into production. Do not create test artifacts in production.

The sandbox API can be found at:

The production API can be found at:
