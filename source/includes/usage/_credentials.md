## Credentials

Thanx will provide you with a Client ID and Client Secret to use in communicating
with our API. These values will be different for sandbox and production. We strongly
recommend that these credentials are never used in an app build for security reasons.
You should proxy your app's calls to Thanx resources through your own server whenever possible.
