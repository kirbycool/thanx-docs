# Webhooks

This section describes webhooks that are available. To request access to our webhook
functionality, please contact your CSM.

In order for Thanx to send webhooks to you, we require an endpoint where you want to receive your payloads.
The payloads are in JSON format and use the same record identifiers as our API endpoints.
