## General requirements

User must be able to navigate to the Thanx Privacy Policy and Terms of Service from the App and the Web Ordering experience after initial sign up has completed when they are using the app on an ongoing basis. Linking to the Thanx Terms of Service and Privacy Policy from another like document that is readily available in the app is sufficient.

## User creation

The following notice with hyperlinks to the Thanx Privacy Policy and Terms of Service must be displayed in all experiences where a user signs up:

<Note>
  By signing up you agree to our [privacy policy](https://app.thanx.com/privacy) and our [terms of service](https://app.thanx.com/terms)
</Note>

Note that you may style this sentence as you'd like. You may replace the default agreement links above with the corresponding brand-specific agreement links Thanx generates for your app:

| Agreement Type | URL Pattern |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Privacy Policy | `https://app.thanx.com/privacy/BRAND` |
| Terms of Service | `https://app.thanx.com/terms/BRAND` |

<Note>
  `BRAND` denotes your designated Thanx platform handle.
</Note>

## Card linkage

Any screen that leverages the Thanx card linkage SDK to register credit cards for loyalty tracking with the major card networks (Visa, Mastercard, Amex) must be explicitly approved by the Thanx team for design and content.
