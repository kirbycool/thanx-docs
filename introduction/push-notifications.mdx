  Thanx sends users push notifications in a variety of situations, such as when
  they make a purchase or earn a reward.
---

We can send push notifications to your app as well. When you are ready to
register your app with Thanx for push notifications, you should send your CSM at
Thanx your APNS certificate, FCM server key, and sender ID via a secure
mechanism, such as Dropbox Transfer

The rest of this page provides information regarding the types of push
notifications that Thanx currently sends.

A push notification payload will contain an event key and a merchant key. Each
notification type may have other information provided. The sample notification
text provided is not set in stone and will sometimes vary depending on the kinds
of campaigns a merchant is running.
