    "description": "This document provides guidance for merchants interested in building their own ordering UI with an ordering provider like Olo. There is actually no integration required outside of the [Thanx SSO](/sso) integration, as ordering providers like Olo have already implemented integrations with Thanx as documented in the [Thanx Loyalty API docs](/loyalty).\n\n![Custom Ordering UI](assets/custom-ordering-ui.png)\n\nAfter the custom ordering UI authenticates the Thanx User (described in the [Thanx SSO docs](/sso), the Thanx token is passed to the ordering provider. The ordering provider in turn uses that access token to fetch qualifying rewards from the Thanx APIs.\n\nHere are some example Olo requests that demonstrate this behavior:\n\n**Exchange Thanx Token for Olo Token**:\n```\n  POST /users/getorcreate\n  {\n    provider:       'thanx', # name of loyalty provider\n    providertoken:  '...',   # thanx access token\n    provideruserid: '...'    # thanx user id\n  }\n```\n\n**Fetch Thanx Rewards**:\n```\n  GET /baskets/{uid}/loyaltyrewards/qualifying?authtoken={olo token}&...\n```",
